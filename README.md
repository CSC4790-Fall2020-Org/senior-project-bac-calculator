Our project is a BAC Calculator Native IOS application. We will use swift to write the backend calculation code for the application, Xcode for the applications interface, and SQL for the database. The project will consist of an interface with a selection of specific alcohol drinks to calculate the BAC. It will also have a friends feature to showcase other BACâ€™s and where they are similar to the snap map interface. 

Project files are located in the "BAC Calculator" folder
